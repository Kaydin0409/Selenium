Advance Xpath:
    *Get to the nearest sibling, parent or ancestor which is uniquely accessible. Then access your desired tag

    //label[@name = 'myid']following-sibling::input
     -->Hey driver get me the tag "label" which has attribute "name" whose value is "myid"
        AND THEN
        get me its following sibling which has the tagname "input"  -->following sibling is the one we are wanting to access

    //label[@name='id']/preceding-sibling::input
    -->Hey driver get me the tag "label" which has attribute "name" whose value is "id"
               AND THEN
               get me its preceding sibling which has the tagname "input"  -->preceding sibling is the one we are wanting to access

    //label[@name='myid']/parent::div
    -->Hey driver get me the tag "label" which has attribute "name" whose value is "myid"
                   AND THEN
                   get me its parent which has the tagname "div"  -->parent is the one we are wanting to access

    //label[@name='myid']/ancestor::form
    -->Hey driver get me the tag "label" which has attribute "name" whose value is "myid"
                       AND THEN
                       get me its ancestor which has the tagname "form"  -->ancestor is the one we are wanting to access

Cascading Xpath:
    *Using 'and' operator on the xpath:
        //iput[@id='user_phone' and @name='phone']
