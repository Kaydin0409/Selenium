Types of WebTables:
1. Static webtables: fixed number of rows and columns
2. Dynamic webtable: changing rows and columns

WebTables consist of different sections or parts:
<table>
    <thead>                    //header of the table
        <tr>
            <th></th>          //column data or heading data
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>                   //the rest of the rows in the table
        <tr>                 //tr refers to rows...you can index to get what row you want tr[1] for example
            <td></td>        //table data represents values in the columns
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
