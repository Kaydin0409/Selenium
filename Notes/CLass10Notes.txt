==>Calendars
    *Also called date-pickers

==>How to Handle Calendars:
    1) Click on Calendar
    2) Locate the month and get text
    3) If the desired text is not visible --> keep clicking on next, and be sure to update month text
    4) As soon as we find our desired text --> grab all the cells from the table
    5) Loop through the cells
    6) Once the cell value is matched with our condition --> click on the matched date

==>Why do We Need ScreenShots in Testing:
    *In testing it is very important to take screenshots in order to prove that our tests covered certain functionality
    *Show whether test passed or failed

==>TakesScreenShot Interface
    *Since you can't create an object from interface must cast to Driver:
        TakesScreenShot tss=(TakesScreenShot)driver;
        File srcFile=ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); //screenshot is taken
