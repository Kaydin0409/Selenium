==>What is a WebElement?
    *Anything we see on a web page is considered to be a WebElement
    *e.g buttons, text boxes, check boxes

==>HTML:
    *Hypertext markup language

==>DOM:
    *DOM stands for Document Object Model.  It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
    *Also called developer's tools or dev tools
    -->Document: a simple HTML document which represents the page we are inspecting
    -->Object: Any line in HTML is considered to be an object
    -->Model: it is just a layout of the HTML

==>Locator:
    *An address or position of a WebElement on the webpage
    *It is used to locate or identify WebElements on the webpage
   **8 Locators**
        - ID
        - Name
        - TagName
        - xpath
        - LinkText
        - PartialLinkText
        - CssSelectors
        - ClassName

==>Why do we need so many locators?
    *Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
    *Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
    *some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
        e.g linktext and partialLinktext are only used for links

-->"a" tag is also called an anchor tag: if you see "a" tag it means it is a link

-->if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, selenium will only interact with the first element it
   locates
