==>Alerts
    *A Pop-up message
    *Take a complete focus of our main page that we are on
    *We cannot proceed further until it is handled

==>Types of Alerts:
    1)Web Based Alerts /HTML Alerts     -->They can be inspected and perform needed actions

    2)Javascript Alerts /Browser Alerts -->part of the browser, not webpage, so cannot be inspected (not stored in DOM)
                                        -->we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        -->Types:
                                            1.Simple Alert: click OK
                                            2.Confirmation Alert: either Cancel or click OK
                                            3.Prompt Alert: enter the Text and click OK or Cancel
                                        -->To Handle these Alerts there are 4 Methods from Alert Interface:
                                            1. accept() - click ok
                                            2. dismiss() - click on cancel
                                            3. getText()
                                            4. sendKeys()

    3)Windows Based Alerts              -->we cannot handle with Selenium
                                        -->your computer window that can pop up from website link--not part of browser or webpage

==>Frames
    *A separate independent window in our webpage
    *Allows devs to represent multiple views on one page
    *3 ways to interact or to switch to a Frame
        1) By index
        2) By name or id
        3) By WebElement

**IN ALERTS: we switch to an alert manually and switch back to main page automatically once done with alert
**IN FRAMES: we switch to frame manually and when finished, switch back to the main page manually

**INTERVIEW QUESTION: How do you handle Alerts in Selenium?**
By using Alert Interface
