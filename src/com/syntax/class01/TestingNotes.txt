    *Non-functional Testing:
      1) performance testing: load/stress; how your application will act in severe load (200,000 users log in, how will it perform)
            -->performance qa testers do this(separate team)
      2) security testing: ensures application is safe (no one can hack application); how easy is it to hack?
